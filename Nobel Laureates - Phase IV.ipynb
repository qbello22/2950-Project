    "#### What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The observations in our data frame are 937 Nobel Prize laureates, representing all winners from the first prizes awarded through the year 2016. In other words, each row represents a single laureate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- id - identifies each laureate \n",
    "- firstname - laureate's first name \n",
    "- surname - laureate's surname \n",
    "- born - laureate's birth date \n",
    "- died - laureate's death date \n",
    "- bornCountry - laureate's birth place \n",
    "- bornCountryCode - the country code of the laureate's country of origin\n",
    "- bornCity - the name of the city where the laureate was born\n",
    "- diedCountry - the name of the country where the laureate died\n",
    "- diedCountryCode - the country code of the laureate's country of death\n",
    "- diedCity - the name of the city where the laureate died\n",
    "- gender - laureate's gender or laureate's organization ('male,' 'female,' or 'org' - organization)\n",
    "- year - the year that the laureate won their prize\n",
    "- category - the category in which the laureate won their prize ('physics,' 'chemistry,' 'peace,' 'medicine,' 'literature,' 'economics')\n",
    "- overallMotivation - overall motivation for being awarded the prize\n",
    "- share - number of other laureates who share the prize \n",
    "- motivation - the motivation behind being awarded the prize\n",

    "#### Why was this dataset created?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was assembled by Maryna Kuzmenko in 2016, and intended to be a starting point for social sciences research into the characteristics of Nobel prize awards and laureates (both quantitative and categorical). It is available through the Harvard Dataverse Repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Harvard's Dataverse Repository is free and open to researchers for sharing and archiving research data. Maryna Kuzmenko holds a Doctorate of Philosophy; no information on the funding for the creation of this particular dataset is available, but it appears to have been created while she was pursuing her doctorate at Kyiv University. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to identify one section of rows that seemed to be included erroneously (containing no data except for the gender characteristic, and not matching with any potential missing data that we could find). As such, we removed those rows from the dataset before continuing with our own analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the nature of our dataset, each instance is identifiable as a specific person, by name, location, age, and more. This was determined not to be a privacy concern, because of the public nature of the Nobel Prize and its laureates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, the Nobel Prize is a prestigious and public-facing award for excellence in a field; as such, information about each year's awards, and the laureates who received them, is generally well-documented. We are reassured by the completeness of our dataset: though not every row is perfectly complete, as a whole data on each laureate is present and accurate (by our appraisal). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data on each laureate was collected into a single .csv file, with each instance representing a single Nobel Prize winner, and columns with characteristics about each of those instances. The entire population of laureates (through 2016) is represented, and no transformations or further processing was done to the data once collected. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there is no record that the Nobel laureates that were living at the time this dataset was assembled were notified, the data collected about them (as at least semi-public figures) is publicly available. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box)\n",

    "One primary limitation of our data is that it was collected in 2016: there have been 6 years' worth of laureates since then, and thus 6 years of data we cannot work with. It is also of some concern that the most recent years are missing: if there are any trends over time in our data, this might limit our ability to accurately model those trends or make predictions. For example, with the raising awareness of gender equality and female awakening efforts in academia, a notable increase in female laureates occurred in the 6 years (2016-2022). 12 women won Nobel in that 6 years, and the total number of female laureates before 2016 is around 60. Therefore, we weren’t able to analyze the rapid change in gender bias. Additionally, a big health challenge, COVID, happened in the three years of the six years with missing data, so we couldn’t analyze how COVID played a role in scientific breakthroughs. Additionally, all the organizations and some people have missing data, such as birth dates, which means that we have to work around those missing data to complete our data analysis."
